# Battle-of-Carrhae
A game made in C# recreating one of the most famous Roman defeats. Unfortunately, the game is in Croatian as I did it as a college project and changing everything to English would require a lot of work, but the tutorial.txt is in English and will explain the game in detail. The game is started by opening the file with .sln extension in OTTER folder and then starting it in Visual Studio. If you have any problems opening it please contact me.
