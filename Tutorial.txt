You start the game from the main menu (upper option).

The game is designed for two players. One controls the Roman (red) army, and the other controls the Parthian (purple) army. The game is divided into phases: the Roman phase and the Parthian phase.

Each phase consists of 15 turns, and a turn is spent on movement (-2 for legionaries and -1 for cavalry and mounted archers) or attacking (-1). After launching the game, the first phase is the Roman phase. You can select any Roman unit by clicking the mouse. Movement is done using the keyboard arrows.

A unit can only move to an empty space. When two enemy units are on adjacent tiles, clicking on the enemy unit initiates a battle (each unit can initiate only one battle in a phase). The results of the battle are displayed on the screen (the left side shows the current status and casulties of the attacker, while the right side does the same for the defender). After 15 turns, it's the Parthians' turn.

The functions are the same for the Parthians. A unit is destroyed if its morale or manpower reaches 0. The winner is the one who destroys all the enemy units.

If you wish to quit the game, press "Exit" in the bottom left corner.
